# AES Encryption

### The implementation of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm

<br>

## Overview
This project implements the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm as a symmetrical block cipher algorithm that takes plaintext in blocks of 128 bits and converts them to ciphertext using keys of 128, 192, and 256 bits.
